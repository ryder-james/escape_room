Dr. Cypher log 42
I have been on Neptune for 49 solar cycles, 
on Earth that would equate to about 31.
Time moves fast here, and every aspect of 
this place is unrelenting. 
The wind can blow at over 2,000 kilometers 
per hour, the outdoor chill will freeze you 
to death almost instantaneously,
and our only solace is this base. But even 
the comfort from the deadly outdoors this 
facility provides starts to be unnerving.
Dark halls lead to dark doors, dark doors 
lead to lone computer systems that lack 
any emotion or compassion.
The other doctors and scientists here seem 
to be exhibiting the same symptoms as I; 
we all seem to be on edge constantly,
the lack of natural light will deteriorate 
your morale and alter your sense of reality.
The thought of never leaving haunts my 
conscious and unconscious mind every moment.
